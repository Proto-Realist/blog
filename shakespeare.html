                    <h2>Modern Shakespeare</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Plato's dialog, "Phaedrus," Socrates made the observation 
                        that poets receive inspiration much in the same way as prophets 
                        or seers. Even though he admits that there is skill involved in 
                        poetry, they are essentially 'gifted' divine knowledge. He also thought that 
                        the poets themselves may not be able to fully understand the 
                        signifigance of their own works because it transcends 
                        human understanding. While Socrates did see the world through the lens of another time, 
                        I do believe that his notice of a poet's special insight are worth 
                        paying attention to.<br><br>
                        My view on poets is a little different, but I do see them as having great 
                        insight that is essential for the rest of us to listen to. Most of us 
                        have gut instincts or these little nudges within us about the world 
                        around us. It could be telling us that some behavior is terribly wrong 
                        or that some action must be taken, or some mindset must be adopted. 
                        For whatever reason that may be unique to each of us, 
                        we end up not fully hearing the message from our inner depths. What I feel 
                        is different about many poets, other than their incredible grasp of 
                        language, is that they are able to hear and bring to life this insight 
                        that is whispering from this 'instinctual world' inside of them. They 
                        then lift it up into the world of conciouse understanding where we can 
                        all see it and take action.

                    <h2>Sonnet: The Digital Isle</h2>
                    <p>
                    Upon this digital isle, we stand alone,<br>
                    In crowds unseen, amidst the silent hum<br>
                    Of wires and waves, where once sweet discourse shone,<br>
                    Now faces glow by artificial sun.<br>
                    Through screens, we touch; in bytes, we speak and sigh,<br>
                    Yet crave the warmth of hand, the gaze unshaded.<br>
                    In this vast web, our spirits soar and fly,<br>
                    Yet, like Icarus, too near the sun, they faded.<br>
                    <br>
                    In virtual halls, we build our Babel high,<br>
                    With likes and hearts, our modern tongues confused.<br>
                    We seek, in vain, to touch the boundless sky,<br>
                    In endless scrolls, our noblest thoughts diffused.<br>
                    Yet still, beneath this network vast and wide,<br>
                    The human heart beats strong, its pulse the tide.<br>
                    <br>
                    In this digital expanse, where shadows play,<br>
                    A bard of old, with quill now turned to light,<br>
                    Explores the soul's array, in disarray.<br>
                    His words, once cloaked in dusk, now shine so bright.<br>
                    Through tempests of the mind, he sails forthright,<br>
                    To chart the depths where modern tempests hide,<br>
                    And in the storm, he finds a guiding light,<br>
                    A beacon for the lost, a timeless guide.<br>
                    <br>
                    For though the seas of time may shift and sway,<br>
                    The human essence, constant, does abide.<br>
                    In every age, the passions thus relay,<br>
                    Love, jealousy, ambition, and our pride.<br>
                    His voice, through centuries, still finds its way,<br>
                    A whisper in the noise, that none can sway.<br>
                    <br>
                    And so, he writes, not just of kings and crowns,<br>
                    But of the common folk, their joys and woes.<br>
                    In tales that span the breadth of human towns,<br>
                    He finds the threads that every fabric knows.<br>
                    From digital divides, new stories rose,<br>
                    Of isolation in a world so vast,<br>
                    Yet also of the hope that still encloses,<br>
                    That through the wire, true connections last.<br>
                    <br>
                    His pen, though now a key, his stage, the cloud,<br>
                    His audience, the world, in pixels dressed.<br>
                    Yet still his art, by time and space unbound,<br>
                    Speaks to the soul, in modern garb expressed.<br>
                    For Shakespeare's craft, in every age renowned,<br>
                    In human hearts, its truest stage is found.<br>
