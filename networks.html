        <h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
        <p>These are links to pages that give a simple description of essential network 
        technologies such as protocols and conceptual models like the TCP/IP suite. I will 
        not be covering every detail, but instead I will be building a mental foundation 
        that is easy to recall when more depth is required.<br><br>
        Once we understand how certain technologies relate to each other, we have access 
        to the big picture. This will be helpful later for building and troubleshooting.</p>
