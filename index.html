        We are and always have been standing at the threshold of the future. It has always been the right time to  
        self-reflect before we take that step through the doorway. If we fail to acknowledge where we came from 
        and what our true nature and values are, then we risk losing the beauty of our heritage. It is 
        true that there is immense pain and suffering in our past. There is also altruism, sacrifice, 
        authenticity, friendship, and the ever-deepening pursuit to find meaning. Just as humanity is 
        capable of intense evil, it is just as capable of good. And I may argue that evil is a direction 
        with a built-in limitations. Its ulitmate achievement is destruction, a very deffinate end. 
        Good is different. It is something that grows and has no limits. <br><br>
        The future is and always has been an opportunity where the best parts of us can truly take hold and 
        lift us out of the world of deceit and oppression. By taking action now, we are finding an ever 
        increasing power to root out the hidden atrocities and the overt violence that has been inflicted 
        on the masses for millennia.<br><br> 
        The purpose of this blog is to explore timeless wisdom and hopefully, get that much closer to the 
        true essence of us. If we pursue who we truly are, I foresee the discovery of the good within us. 
        It is paramount that humanity looks at this good and use it as the guiding principles. It is not 
        reasonable to believe that all people will do this. What is reasonable is that deep thinkers take 
        the initiative to guide and teach. Not just speak, but live these truths. Even when it costs us 
        everything. Every voice adds to humanity and drives us closer to a better future. There is power 
        in this. Perhaps it is the only real power any of us has ever really needed. Good takes effort. 
        Good takes diligence. Good takes a sincere and passionate drive, much like a sapling reaching for 
        the light in a dark forest.
