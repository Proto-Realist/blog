                <p>One of my highest axiomatic beliefs is that we all should leave the world a 
                little better than we found it. This is why I am sharing my journey through the 
                technology world. Anyone with a passion for this subject invariably spends 
                countless hours studying and exploring and I wanted my efforts to have a 
                greater impact than just my learning. I am hopeful that my interests and insights 
                will help others along the way. Everytime someone sincerely contributes to a field, 
                we all benefit.<br><br>
                No matter how small the impact, these are my personal understandings and descriptions 
                of the technologies I am exploring.</p>
