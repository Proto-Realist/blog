          <h3>The Basics of MPLS</h3>
          <p>This is a protocol that operates at the network layer in the OSI model. 
            Because it has attributes that resemble those of the Data Link layer, it is described as 
            operating at layer 2.5 of the OSI Model. Essentially between the Data link and 
            Network layers.<br><br>
            
            It is typically faster than using the standard internet protocols because of its 
            use of pre-planned routes. These routes are called Label Switched Paths (LSP). 
            Another unique characteristic of MPLS is the Label. While traditional protocols 
            rely on IP addresses to route packets, MPLS uses labels. The functional difference 
            lies in how they traverse the routers on their hops.

            <strong>Train Ride Analogy</strong>
            <br><br>
            
            The typical internet protocol 
            would be like a driver in a car trying to find their way through rush-hour traffic. 
            This driver knows the destination address, but does not know how to get there. So 
            driver, (packet) stops at every intersection (router) along the way to ask for 
            directions. This is time consuming because a calculation needs to take place at 
            every hop. Another downside is when the packet runs into a congested or broken 
            path. It now needs to make the best decision of what is available to continue on its way.
            <br><br>

            Now, the MPLS packet is more like a passenger riding on a train. A real-world train 
            follows tracks that are put into place long before the train or passenger starts 
            their journey. This means that the engineers were able to plan out the most efficient 
            routes to avoid damaged areas and congested areas. This makes for faster paths compared 
            to last minute adjustments along the way. For unexpected obstacles, there are backup 
            routes already assigned. The tracks in our analogy would 
            be the Label Switched Paths (LSP) in a network. Just like train tracks are planned 
            by Railway Engineers, the LSP is laid out by Network Engineers.
            The LSP is specific to each region where it has been set up. So every packet that 
            is following this LSP takes the same route through that specific part of the network. 
            <br><br>

            Now our analogous passenger has a ticket book to ride the train. This would be the Label 
            on the MPLS packet. Now as the passenger (packet) hops from network to network, they show 
            the ticket to the router. Then the passenger (packet) goes along for the ride without 
            asking for any directions.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Advantages</strong>
            <br><br>
            
            The benefit to this is that it eliminates the need to calculate the next step at each hop, 
            saving processing time. It also takes the most efficient route around congestion and 
            obstacles instead of looking for the best way through the problem areas.
            <br><br>

            <strong>Name Break Down</strong>
            <br><br>

            Now, the meaning of the name Multi-Protocol Label Switching. 'Multi Protocol' simply means that 
            it is capable of encapsulating many different types of protocols. The 'Label Switching' part requires  
            some explanation. In our earlier analogy, the label was much like a ticket that allowed the 
            packet to get onto the Label Switch Path (LSP).<br><br>

            Because of the vastness of the internet, there are many individual LSPs that a packet may need 
            travel to get to its destination. Each LSP requires a distinct label for the packet to travel 
            its path. So the switching part happens when the packet reaches the end of the LSP and needs to 
            start on another. The old label is then 'switched' for a new one that matches the new LSP.
