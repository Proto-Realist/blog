          <h3>The Basics of MPLS</h3>
          <p>This is a protocol that operates at the Network layer in the OSI model. 
            Because it has attributes that mimic Datalink layer, it is described as 
            being at layer 2.5 of the OSI Model. Essentially between the Data link and 
            Network layers.<br><br>
            
            It is typically faster than using the standard internet protocols because of its 
            use of preplanned routes. These routes are called Label Switched Paths (LPS). 
            Another unique characteristic of MPLS is the Label. While the usual protocols 
            have the IP address guiding the packet, MPLS uses labels. The funtional difference 
            is how they traverse the routers on its hops.
            <br><br>
            
            Lets use an analogy to help clarify how this works.
            <br><br>
            
            The typical internet protocol 
            would be like a driver in a car trying to find their way through rush-hour traffic. 
            This driver knows the destination address, but does not know how to get there. So 
            driver, (packet) stops at every intersection (router) along the way to ask for 
            directions. This is time consuming because a calculation needs to take place at 
            every hop. Another downside is when the packet runs into a congested or broken 
            path. It now needs to make the best of what is available to continue on its way.
            <br><br>

            Now the MPLS packet is more like a passenger riding on a train. A real world train 
            follows tracks that would put into place long before the train or passenger started 
            their journey. This means that the engineers were able to plan out the most efficient 
            routes to avoid damaged areas and congested areas. The tracks in our analogy would 
            be the Label Switched Paths (LPS) in a network. Just like train tracks are planned 
            by Railway Engineers, the LPS is laid out by Network Engineers.
            The LPS is specific to each region where it has been set up. So every packet that 
            is following this LPS takes the same route through that specific part of the network. 
            <br><br>

            Now our analogous passenger has a ticket book to ride the train. This would be the Label 
            on the MPLS packet. Now as the passenger (packet) hops from network to network, they show 
            the ticket to the router. Then the passenger (packet) goes along for the ride without 
            asking for any directions.
            <br><br>

            The benefit to this is that it elminates the need to calculate the next step at each hop, 
            saving processing time. It also takes the most efficient route around congestion and 
            obstacles instead of looking for the best way through the problem areas.
