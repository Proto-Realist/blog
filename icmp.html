          <strong>ICMP Basics</strong><br><br>
          Introduced in 1981, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a fundamental part of the TCP/IP suite. Because of its automated messages that 
          provide feedback about a packets journey, it is essential for network diagnostics. It is most commonly known for its error reporting messages, like 
          'Desitination Unreachable' and its utilization in diagnostic tools like Ping and TracerRoute and NMAP.<br><br>
